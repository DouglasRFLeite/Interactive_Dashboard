# TimeSeriesInteractiveDashboard
### Interactive Dashboard with Performance Analysis on Time Series Unemployment Data built as exercise during Data Science Academy's Power BI course.

These are the reference, dataset and Dashboards I`ve built during the fifth chapter of [Data Science Academy's Power BI Course](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=microsoft-power-bi-para-data-science) as a case study. For more information on it check my Medium post [Interactive Dashboard and Performance Analyzer with Unemployment Time Series](https://medium.com/@douglas.rochedo/interactive-dashboard-and-performance-analyzer-with-unemployment-time-series-e37d0f865d5c).

PS: Data Science Acadamy is a Brazilian course given in Portuguese, thus, all of the content provided by the course is in Portuguese. All content in English is made by me and I shall not translate everything to English. So, if you want to understand better what I have done here, it is best you check the Medium post than try to understand from the content available here.
